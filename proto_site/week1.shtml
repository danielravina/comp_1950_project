								</div>
								<h3>Web space</h3>
								<div class="content-block">
									<p>Each student will get personal webspace.  This may be different than in the past, as this space is exclusively yours, with your own username and password.</p>
									<p>This is also not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one).  This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more.  Make it a site that is usable and functional.</p>
									<h3>TheNet Setup</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Your account name has already been created: first initial + last name. Example, John Smith would be jsmith</li>
										<li>Passwords were randomized at account creation, so you will have to create yours</li>
										<li>Be prepared to enter your password when you come to the front
											<li>Your URL will be: <strong>http://students.thenet.ca/{accountname}</strong></li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<h3>FTP into your Account</h3>
									<div class="content-block">
										<p>You can use any FTP program you are comfortable with. There is most likely one installed in the labs (it changes from term to term) but you can download and install any one you want.</p>
										<p><a href="https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a> is a great FTP client that works on Mac/PC/Linux if you are looking for one to install on your laptop or at home</p>
										<p>If you aren't knowledgeable with any FTP programs yet, just let me know!</p>
										<p>Here is the relevant information you will need to know:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Host / IP / URL: <strong>thenet.ca</strong></li>
											<li>Username (It's important that you have the accountname <strong>and</strong> the domain for your Username to work): <strong>{accountname}@thenet.ca</strong></li>
											<li>Password: <strong>{the password you entered}</strong></li>
										</ul>

									<h2 id="exercises">Exercise</h2>
									<p>Create your course web site:</p>
									<p>Check out the example page created by a past student: Lori's Example</p>
									<p>Specifically, what I would like to see:</p>
									<p>On your homepage:</p>
									<p>Include some information about yourself (such as from your introduction today) including a photo</p>
									<p>For week one, please be sure these elements are added somewhere:</p>
									<p>A brief overview of your web development skill level</p>
									<p>Description of web development work you have done so far (links to examples or screenshots)</p>
									<p>Links to favourite sites, either because of esthetic, technology, etc</p>
									<p>A list of applications, tools, browser plug-ins or IDEs that you use for web development. Include a link to each of these tools.</p>
									<p>Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to the limit of your knowledge, but ensure that it is usable, presentable and coherent</p>
									<p>This site will be used for the rest of the course, edited each week</p>
									<p>If we do an exercise in class or if you are assigned something for homework, please make sure you indicate that. Link to exercises and assignments from the appropriate week. Don't make me have to search for your homework.</P>
										<p>One caveat: No Javascript at all</p>
										<p>There needs to be a link from the myBCIT Members page to your Student Homepage</p>
